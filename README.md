# AI Learning — Age Classification Project

## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning workflow that predicts whether a person is over 30 years old based on simple features such as age and city.

The goal is to understand the full ML lifecycle:
data → features → model → probabilities → decisions.

## Project Structure
data/ # CSV files and charts
notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
src/ # Python scripts
models/ # Saved trained models


## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## What I Learned
- How to structure a real ML project
- Difference between scripts and notebooks
- Feature engineering and label encoding
- Probabilistic model outputs vs hard decisions
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Next Steps
- Improve feature engineering
- Add model evaluation metrics
- Expose the model via a simple API
